This is a Drupal installation profile that I use in order to bring up a dev
environment very quickly. My purpose for using it is for new project
applications.

It includes a pretty standard installation profile with the addition of the
following:
- coder
- security_review
- devel

I borrowed quite a bit from the Aten Development Base profile
(http://drupal.org/project/aten_dev_base)

and added a build script for ease of use.

usage:
open the ./build script and change the configurations for the database (user,
pass,host,name)
from the commandline: ./build <target to build>
example: ./build /var/www/apptest

You may need sudo to run this as it does a couple chmod commands that require
it.
